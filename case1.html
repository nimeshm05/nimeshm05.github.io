        Project Overview
      </h2>
      <p class="lead">
        This project is designed for students to meliorate their experience of
        scheduling a meet with professors to improve mutual schedule
        convenience. The project is in implementation phase and UX research is
        conducted with students and other stakeholders of the campus
      </p>

    <div class="container" style="margin-top: 3em">
      <h2 class="display-4" style="color: rgb(233, 38, 87)">Observation</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        From the past 6 months, I’ve observed that the student members from
        various student organizations and clubs in the college often get
        frustrated for being impuissant. By conducting a few interviews and
        tea-table talks with the students, I observed and recognized one common
        problem, i.e, differing schedules between students and professors(or
        other stakeholders). Communication between different stakeholders of the
        campus is very important for the comprehensive growth of innovation in
        the campus.

        Interviews and Synthesis
      </h2>
      <p class="lead">
        After observations, the team conducted chronological interviews over the
        past 8 months with the students on the campus. By interacting with them,
        we observed their behavioral responses and discerned their concerns. We
        analyzed various students' responses and developed an inference. Another
        interesting fact is, we didn’t conduct surveys through Google forms
        because the team wanted to empathize and understand their concerns
        deeply, and hence the interview process lasted for a few months(1-2). We
        structured the synthesis in the following way(Below mentioned is just
        one example):
      </p>
      <h3 class="display-4">The synthesis</h3>
      <ul class="list-group list-group-flush" style="margin-top: 2em">
        <li class="list-group-item">
          I talked to XXXX who is a freshman at VVCE.

        <li class="list-group-item">
          XXXX is an eloquent person and is amazed to see various
          extra-curricular clubs in college

        <li class="list-group-item">
          XXXX felt infuriated for not being able to meet professors whenever he
          wanted to meet them.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          I wonder if this means that students like XXXX cast down if they lose
          their precious time waiting to meet professors.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          How might we help students connect with professors at a scheduled time

      <h2 class="display-4" style="color: rgb(233, 38, 87)">The Problem</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Students in the campus communicate and coordinate with different
        stakeholders for numerous reasons. For example, student leaders
        communicate with faculty coordinators to acquire consent to organize
        club related activities. Students often have to walk around the huge
        campus and wait for hours until the respective stakeholder is free or,
        is present in his/her office. Students lose their valuable time and
        delay the work. This results in the development of disinterest over some
        time and students eventually lack the motivation to conduct club related
        activities.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container" style="margin-top: 3em">
      <h2 class="display-4" style="color: rgb(38, 233, 113)">The Challenge</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        How might we help the students engage their valuable time with different
        stakeholders of the campus? The students and other stakeholders of the
        campus have different time schedules each day. Hence, the challenge
        rested in identifying a mutually convenient time and acquaint the
        students with time schedule information of different stakeholders of the
        campus.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container" style="margin-top: 3em">
      <h2 class="display-4" style="color: rgb(38, 233, 113)">Major Goals</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        After conducting interviews, studying student and stakeholder behaviors,
        identifying the challenges and problems, the team ideated on innovative
        solutions. One such optimal and innovative solution is to develop a
        mobile app that displays the time schedule information of all the
        stakeholders of the campus. By building the mobile app, we seek help
        from the student tech clubs and therefore leveraging opportunities for
        the Tech students to work on a project. The integrated work between
        various students leveraged a lot of opportunities and solves the problem
        too.

        Wireframes and Prototypes
      </h2>
      <p class="lead">
        I was responsible to create wireframes, user flows, design, and
        prototypes of the mobile app. This was an intriguing piece of work for
        me.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        For design and prototypes, I used Adobe XD and Adobe Illustrator
        software tools. Although Adobe XD provided issues with font variations,
        I was able to convince and coordinate the developers by communicating
        with them.

        This conceptualization has two login page processes, one for the phone
        number and another for USN(College ID for each student). The reason for
        the two login page process is to make the user flow smoothly instead of
        spending more time to fill information on one interface.

        The landing page displays relevant information for the user. The
        students can use the search bar to search for the name of the faculty to
        check availability time. The landing page also displays the upcoming
        activities that allow the students to quickly access information about
        activity and faculty associated with that activity. This design is
        minimal for a landing page and hence more desirable for the users.

        The calendar page displays the availability time of professors. The
        timetable for each professor has been stored in the backend and
        accordingly, the app calendar updates with changes made to the
        professor's schedule. The green boxes indicate that the professor is
        available during those hours.

      <p class="lead">
        So far, the only first phase of prototypes is made. The responses
        received after deploying the app can help us analyze student behavior,
        based on which we can modify or add new elements to the wide spectrum of
        characteristics.

        Prototypes were tested with the students and 80% of them admired the
        idea of deploying an app mainly for scheduling appointments with
        professors, while the rest 20% wanted an overall integration of all the
        college-related information(Attendance status, Fee payment status, Club

        Conclusion and Learning
      </h2>
      <p class="lead">
        From the above project, I understood that problems can be viewed as
        challenges, challenges can be viewed as opportunities and, opportunities
        are the pathway to unseen optimal possibilities.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        By keeping the users(students and professors) at the forefront, I could
        derive insights. This enabled me to empathize with them and therefore
        found the motivation to solve problems. Deploying design thinking
        principles for this particular project aided me to analyze and
        understand “Design thinking for higher education”.
